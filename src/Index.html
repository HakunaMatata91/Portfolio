               <p>I have no commercial experience as a Front-End developer, but I believe that with determination and
                  hard
                  work, anything
                  is possible.</p>
               <p>During my four-year experience as an IT recruiter, I had the opportunity to work with clients from the
                  United States,
                  the Middle East, and Europe. This exposure ignited my passion for the IT industry and motivated me to
                  pursue a career as
                  a Front-End developer</p>
               <p> I completed the Junior Front-End Developer courses with honors at Main Academy from March 2021 to
                  October
                  2021. The
                  program covered HTML/CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Photoshop in a comprehensive 140-hour
                  curriculum.

                  curriculum.
               </p>
               <p>After completing the courses, I continued to study Front-End development independently, expanding my
                  knowledge beyond
                  what I learned in the program. I have applied this knowledge in practical projects and achieved
                  tangible
                  I am dedicated to continuously improving my skills and knowledge in the field. I would greatly
                  appreciate
                  the
                  opportunity to complete a test task to demonstrate my abilities.
               </p>
               <p>I am seeking a Trainee/Junior position where I can contribute my current skills while being open to
                  learning
                  anything necessary
                  for the job.</p>
