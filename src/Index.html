               I have no commercial experience as a Front-End developer, but I believe that with determination and hard
               work, anything
               is possible.

               During my four-year tenure as an IT recruiter in outsourcing and outstaffing companies, I conducted
               numerous interviews
               and witnessed candidates without technical education or prior experience securing exciting projects. If
               they could do
               it, I am confident that I can too!

               I completed the Junior Front-End Developer courses with honors at Main Academy from March 2021 to October
               2021. The
               program covered HTML/CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Photoshop in a comprehensive 140-hour
               curriculum.

               After completing the courses, I continued to study Front-End development independently, expanding my
               knowledge beyond
               what I learned in the program. I have applied this knowledge in practical projects and achieved tangible
               results.

               I am dedicated to continuously improving my skills and knowledge in the field. I would greatly appreciate
               the
               opportunity to complete a test task to demonstrate my abilities.

               I am seeking a Trainee/Junior position where I can contribute my current skills while being open to
               learning
               anything necessary
               for the job.
